 * The target is government, multilateral and non-profit research, plus the
 * consultancies that serve them. Those readers screen on sector and method
 * before they screen on tooling, which is why the first card is a list of who
 * the work was for and what it was — not a list of capabilities.
 *
 * This section used to be headed "Services" with cards for mixing and live
 * sessions. That is vendor framing, and on the page directly below a hero that
 * says "open to new roles" it answered a question nobody asked. The music work
 * did not disappear - it lives in src/content/work.ts and renders in the
 * Portfolio section on this same page and on /work.
 *
 * Every bullet names something that exists in this repo or in a public one.
