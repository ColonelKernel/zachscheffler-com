/**
 * The narrative section, and deliberately only the narrative.
 *
 * This used to re-render EDUCATION and CAREER_TIMELINE — the same two arrays
 * /cv maps — so a reader who saw both pages read the whole résumé twice, and
 * the homepage carried a second copy of a table that already had a page of
 * its own. It also restated CV_PROFILE.summary, the Global Pulse description
 * from work.ts, and the Streetcar Scandal blurb from work.ts, each of which
 * renders elsewhere on this same page or one click away.
 *
 * What is left is the part that exists nowhere else: why this particular
 * combination is rare, and what the through-line actually is. The tables are
 * one link away, which is where a reader who wants a résumé was always going
 * to go.
 *
 * The music is one clause and a link rather than a paragraph. It is real and
 * it explains the software habit, but for a government or NGO reader it is the
 * least load-bearing fact here, and it used to get equal billing with seven
 * years of commissioned public work.

                My professional data work began with organizations accountable to the
                public: a development bank, a federal health agency, a foundation, a
                country strategy. I came to it through public policy rather than a
                computer-science program — an M.P.P. at UCLA in transportation and urban
                development, field research for the World Bank in Peru, computational
                social science at NORC — and I learned to build the software because the
                analysis kept needing it.

                That is the combination on offer. Most people who can supervise fourteen
                enumeration teams in two provinces cannot also write the scraper that
                recovers six million exam records from a portal with no bulk export, and
                most people who can write the scraper have never watched a survey
                instrument fail in the field. I have done both, for the same client, in the
                same year. My music practice contributes a second set of engineering problems: timing,
                interaction, and tools that keep the performer in control. The recordings are{" "}

                The through-line is measurement. Ridership across 201 transit systems,
                retention across six million exam records, cortisol against a
                subjective-wellbeing scale — the work is deciding what a number means
                before trusting it, and saying so when it turns out not to mean that. On
                the transit data that cost me the result I wanted, which is the version of
                this I would rather be judged on.
