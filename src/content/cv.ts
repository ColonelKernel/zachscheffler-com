  // The sector leads because that is where the seven years are — World Bank,
  // USAID through NORC, CMS through Rios — and because government, multilateral
  // and non-profit postings screen on "policy" and "public" before they screen
  // on tooling. The specialism follows it rather than replacing it: the UCLA
  // M.P.P. is literally titled Transportation & Urban Development, and the
  // transit atlas is the largest artifact here.
  //
  // "ML Engineer" comes out of the headline for this market and stays in the
  // summary and the skills. It is a claim about tooling, and these readers want
  // the method and the domain first.

  summary:
    "Seven years of applied data work for governments, multilaterals and foundations. At the World Bank I managed 14 field teams across metropolitan Lima and the rural Sierra Central and built the project database that reported on them in real time. At NORC I assembled over six million exam records from Tanzania's National Examinations Council to inform USAID's Country Development Cooperation Strategy, and ran NLP over social-media corpora for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. At Rios Partners I grew the data strategy work from an informal group into a standing practice and led it, establishing a new enterprise data inventory for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. My UCLA M.P.P. is in Transportation & Urban Development. The World Transit Atlas is the clearest public sample of how I work: 201 rail systems and 22,641 stations assembled from OpenStreetMap and open agency data, and a ridership audit that dismantled my own significant result rather than publishing it. I build the software as well as the analysis \u2014 pipelines, models and the interfaces over them \u2014 and I did not come up through a computer-science program.",
