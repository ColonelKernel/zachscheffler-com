/**
 * Colour contrast, measured in a real browser.
 *
 * There are three layers of defence here and each one exists because the layer
 * above it was proven insufficient:
 *
 *   1. `npm run lighthouse` — the one check that ever caught a contrast bug,
 *      and on 2026-09-21 it was measured missing one: /cv scored accessibility
 *      1.00 while rendering a 4.21:1 label. axe cannot always resolve an
 *      alpha-composited colour against the surface behind it, so it reports
 *      "incomplete" rather than "fail".
 *   2. `src/app/contrast.test.ts` — arithmetic over the source text. Fast,
 *      names the offending file, and covers the case this codebase actually
 *      hits (a Tailwind opacity modifier on --muted-foreground). It cannot see
 *      a hardcoded hex, a coloured background, or a colour computed at runtime,
 *      because it never renders anything.
 *   3. This file — reads `getComputedStyle` off a live page, so it sees the
 *      final colour no matter how it was authored.
 *
 * Animations are disabled and `.fade-up` is forced visible before measuring:
 * those elements start at `opacity: 0` and only gain `.visible` on
 * intersection, so without this the probe would either measure mid-transition
 * values or skip everything below the fold.
 *
 * Text drawn over a background image cannot be measured this way — the
 * effective backdrop is whatever pixel happens to sit behind each glyph. Those
 * are reported separately and counted rather than silently passed, so the set
 * cannot quietly grow.
 */

/**
 * Where text legitimately sits on something this probe cannot measure, and why
 * each one is fine anyway. Anything outside this list fails with its details
 * printed, so a new image-backed text block has to be justified here rather
 * than quietly inherited.
 *
 * Counts are deliberately not pinned — they move with content (how many
 * embeds /work renders, how many strings the fretboard draws) without the
 * design changing. The zone is the stable fact.
 *
 *   "/"              #hero — the H1 and lede are white over a photograph with
 *                    a `bg-black/65` scrim. nav — the navbar is transparent at
 *                    the top of the homepage, so it too sits on that photo.
 *                    Both are in Lighthouse's audited viewport, which is the
 *                    check that covers them; it scores / at accessibility 1.00.
 *   "/work"          #work-embeds — "Load … player" is white/90 on a YouTube
 *                    poster frame, a third-party image with no fixed colour.
 *                    The facade draws a dark gradient behind the label.
 *   "/tools/harmony" #fretboard — string labels are stone-400 (#a8a29e) on an
 *                    inline gradient from hsl(30 20% 12%) to hsl(25 25% 10%).
 *                    Computed by hand: 6.49:1 at the light end, 6.91:1 at the
 *                    dark end. Passes AA across the whole gradient; the probe
 *                    simply cannot read a gradient.
